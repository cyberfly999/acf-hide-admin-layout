# acf-hide-admin-layout
Simple Wordpress-Plugin to hide Admin-only ACF Flexible Layouts from popumenu

### Installation
Go to [releases](https://github.com/januardesignbuero/acf-hide-admin-layout/releases) and download the most recent version.

In WP, go to ```Plugins > Add new``` and click the upload button.

### How to use
On Pages, Posts and everywhere, where ACFs Flexible Content takes place, you can now do the following:
- Prefix a FlexibleLayout Name with [ADMIN:].
- Log into WP with a user role other than Administrator.
Now try to add this prefixed layout... You can't because it is omitted.
